How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It was easy since it made comparing the files easier and the bugs could be found easily rather than line by line comparison of the lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having an entire history of the file helps a programmer refer previous versions of the file if the newer version stops working.
Also it helps to understand how the file has evolved over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manually saving in Git seems to be a better option,since the user knows when to save the changes.
In Google Docs the documents are saved whether the changes may be large or small and user has no control over it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It is good to save multiple files at one place since one change would have changed other files too. It is easy to find the changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 git log helps to find all the commits made to the file with its history.
 git diff helps to compare the changes made to file in separate dates in history.
 
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

git checkout helps to go the older versions of the file.Thus we can make changes easily and go back to previous versions of sometthing breaks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
